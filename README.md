# Flight Fare Prediction App

## Author
Name: Simon Lim

## Description
This application is a machine learning product, which can predict the expected flight fare for different airport trips. 
In particular, this project split the travel airfare into 4 different fares, including minimum, median, modal and mean of airfare
Together, these metrics aim to provide a comprehensive overview of potential fares to users.
To enable model’s access to users, Docker and Streamlit were used for model deployment, enabling users to use the models as a application.


## How to Run the Program
Execute the following steps to run the app:
- Clone the main branch from the github repo:  https://github.com/SimonLim03/Flight-Fare-Prediction-App.git OR download zip folder
- Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal 
- Run the following commands:

    - `docker run -p 7860:7860 flight-fare-app`
- Navigate to http://localhost:7860
- Fill in the input form and hit submit!
